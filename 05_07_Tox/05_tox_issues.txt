Mismatches between IUCLID/KCA:
- Short-term toxicity:
	Endpoints are short-term, sub-chronic, chronic and other.
     - division between 28d/90d for oral: based on endpoint short-term (assumed 28 day) and sub-chronic (assumed 90 day), and not on actual duration value.
     - other routes: doesn't have divisions but in IUCLID there is inhalation, dermal and other. Currently this subsections are added. 
	Another option: merge all togeter in one bigger section "other" (as in legis)
     - general issue: chronic should go to long-term studies, but, what to do with "OTHER"? At the moment: for oral, a section "other" is created. For the rest (dermal, inhalation, other)
	they are included in this section together with short-term and sub-chronic studies.
	Another option: put "other" together with "sub_chronic"

- Genotoxicity: in vivo studies
	- divided into somatic and germ studies, based on endpoint BUT some endpoints overlap (correspond or can correspond to both). For the time being this section is not considered.
	All in vivo studies are shown together. Another options: add subsection "other" for ambiguous cases or ignore.

- Long-term toxicity and carcinogenicity: the doc in iuclid only refers to carcinogenicity. However, there are endpoints for long-term toxicity in the documents in
repeated dose-toxicity (chronic). These will be included but separated in two sections. NEED TO MODIFY THE CROSSWALKS.
	- problem: summary document in repeated dose toxicity includes chronic toxicity. But in carcinogenicity PPP doc there is also long-term tox...This one is used only.
		other option: fetch data if "chronic" and show only in this subsection?

- Reproductive toxicity: whole section very confusing, endpoints don't seem to be in the right places. Probably to redo and to MODIFY CROSSWALKS.
	- uncategorised study record includes generational studies (+ some developmental, +other)
	- generational studies include only endpoint "other"
	- developmental studies include endpoint "developmental toxicity" but not other included in the first (developmental immunotixicity, neurotoxicity)
	At the moment, this section is rearranged in repgen:
		- new section: ToxicityReproductionOther (at moment in dev section ??) + endpoints from ToxicityReproduction not included in other sections
		- generational studies: all endpoints "generation" from ToxicityReproduction
		- dev: endpoints "developmental immuno/neurotoxicity" from ToxicityReproduction + DevelopmentalToxicityTeratogenicity
		Another option: merge "new section" into generational studies.

- neurotoxicity:
      - in rodents: list of rodents? only rat and mouse? (there are hamsters too) what if "other"? what about non-rodents? Options:
		1. Add section "other" (current)
		2. Ignore.
		3. Remove "rodents" of section and just list everything.
      - delayed polyneuropathy: select "other" and write explicitely (OK, but need to exclude this option from first section (not to repeat if this was in rodents))

- metabolites (see how to accommodate this)

- other toxicological studies: 
	- where to put additional toxicological information? Options:
		- without category - not optimal
		- separate category - but doesn't exist in legislation (current)
		- under supplementary studies 
	- suplementary studies: it doesn't have distinctions, but IUCLID has two - probaby best option is to add these two
	- intermediate effects: does not exist in legislation

- medical data:
	- for directOsbersvationsClinicalCases: not context in crosswalks. How to split between sections in legislation? Options:
		1. split
		2. All in one section (current)

Other:
- how to order studies? e.g. in some dossiers they first report on dogs, then rats, etc...should we have some sort of criteria for ordering?
- duration of exposure: change from free text to value + unit (day, month, year, h, min, s...)
- species: possibility of multiple list?

Inclusion/exclusion results from endpoint study records:
-----------------------------------------------------------
5.1 -> missing preliminary studies, enzymatic activity and bioaccessibility.
5.2.1-2-3,7 -> only effect levels; missing fields: preliminary study, mortality, clinical signs, body weight, gross pathology, other findings
5.2.4.1-2 -> missing some fields in in vivo/in vitro (other effects, irritant/corrosive response data); and also the tables don't include all values 
5.2.5 -> (invitro) missing: outcome of prediction model, other effects (inVivoLLNA) missing cellular proliferation data. NOTE!: if endpoint "other" is selected, these resutls are not printed at all!
5.2.6 -> whole new
5.3.1-2-3-4, 5.5,5.7,5.8.2.1 -> missing results of examinations
5.4.1-2 -> just missing details
5.6.1 -> only includes effects levels and system/organ tox!
5.6.2 -> missing observed effects
5.6.3 -> only includes effect levels and abnormalities
5.8.2.1 -> no examinations/immonological specific
5.8.2.2 -> new as a loop (TO DO: add labels)
5.8.3 -> new, but missing examinations (to do same as with others)
5.8.4 -> TODO
5.9.1,2,4 -> all
5.9.3 -> only results of examinations

Summary results
--------------------------------------------------
1. ToxRefValues -> missing
2. Toxicokinetics -> macro exists. Questions:
	- why document only has endpoints for absortion (and not rest of ADME)? In existing dossiers there is a nice table compiled for that.
	- why in linked studies there is an option of Dermal Absortion?
	- in the macro i would change how things are displayed e.g. 
		- link to study records: more compact, with a title, with LINK, and ONLY RECORDS FOR WHICH STUDIES ARE DISPLAYED (same to be applied in physchem table)
		- sections: key information, value used for CSA, links, discussion
2. Acute Toxicity/irritation/sensisisation/phototoxicity(this one missing): sections don't make sense as of new regarding these summaries. Options:
	1. Redefine sections.
	2. Merge summary documents into a big summary at the beginning of the whole section (i favour this option). Maybe an option would be a summary table a la physchem. Probably a macro can be done, that can accomodate different input for different sections?
	
3. Repeated dose toxicity. Very similar considerations as above. Table format would be good. And also:
	- both summary records and endpoint study records have three types of study: short/subacute, subchronic, chronic. It would make sense one summary for each of them, but this value can be given
	independentely to every endpoint. 
	Idea: validation rule -> ensure that all values are the same? Also in this case it wouldn't fit the option of only one summary record but up to 3 could be used.
	Also, this links with the long-term studies not being properly classified (under carcinogenicity)

4. Genotoxicity. Exists. Similar comment, maybe table format not so worth in this case (but could also be used). In this case key information is within section, and not general.
5. Carcinogenicity. Missing (exist but not EU_PPP), although the existing one can work for the carcinogenicity part.
	- question: there is summary for long term toxicity, but in this section no endpoint summary for this are available. This is all confusing.
6. Reproductive toxicity: missing (it's EU PPP)
7-8. Neurotox / other. Exists but combined into one (also with Immunotox)-> i would need to separate it, at minimum.
	8.2.2 -> livestock doesn't exist
	8.3 -> EndocrineDisruptingPropertiesAssessmentPest odes not exist -> and has a very different structure!

9. Medical data. Exists.

10. NonDietaryExposure
	- terrible document: mistake in paths etc

-> conclusion of this:
	- some summaries could be put into a table: they have a similar structure with endpoints etc...
	- others are very basic (medical data, additional properties etc) and could be treated in non-table format, but in the same way
	- only a few are very specific: ED? something else?
	I think it could all be treated in a macro. DONE.
