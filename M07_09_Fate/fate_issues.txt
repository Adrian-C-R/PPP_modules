CHEM SUB
---------------------------------

7.1.1.2: instead of being only "anaerobic" it will be everything that is not aerobic.

7.1.2: this whole section is just a summary plus links for the studies. However, how to link to the metabolites? Just say that it should be another section?

7.1.2.2.2: same strategy as in 7112

7.1.4.4: added section to cover "other" endpoints

7.222-4: separated by endpoint and inoculum - update the crosswalks.

7.2.3: same strategy as in 7112 (together with 7.2.2.1)

NOTE: why aerobic mineralisation doc is different than the one used for substance??? makes no sense
