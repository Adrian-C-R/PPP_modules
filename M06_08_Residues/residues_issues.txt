For chemicals
---------------

- ENDPOINT_SUMMARY.MetabolismPlants is used in 2 places: metabolism in plants and metabolism in rotational crops.
	- solution implemented: retrieve only the corresponding rotational crop vs primary crop info to display, but then general info might be repeated
	- alternative: just link to one place

- ENDPOINT_STUDY_RECORD.ResiduesInRotationalCrops is used in 3 places: magnitude in plants, in peel and pulp and in rotational crops.
	- solution implemented:
		- distinction between plants (incl peel and pulp) and rotational crops done by using Endpoint value
		- not possible to distinguish for peel and pulp (ResultsAndDiscussion.SummaryOfRadioactiveResiduesInCrops.SamplingAndResidues.SampledMaterialCommodity IN ["FI 0030", "FT 0026"] is repeatable...) so link provided

- ENDPOINT_SUMMARY.MagnitudeResiduesPlants similar as above
	- solution implemented: 
		- separated between plants and rotational crops by flag "KeyInformation.SummaryResiduesData.ResultsApplicableTo", but then general info might be repeated
	 	- however for peel and pulp the only solution is to provide a link (to primary crops only? or both?)

- FLEXIBLE_SUMMARY.MRLProposal: used in MRLs for both imported and non-imported products.
	- solution implemented: report in first section and add link in second
	- alternative: use context MaximumResidueLevel.RationaleForMrl="import of food of animal origin" to split this doc

- 6.8- Proposed safety intervals: 
	- solution implemented: just message to check GAP
	- alternative: we could extract info if necessary :)
		- legislation: pre-harvest intervals for envisaged uses, or withholding periods or storage periods, in the case of post-harvest uses
		- dossiers have small tables for it

- 6.11 Migration of residues into and their behaviour on food or feeding stuffs -> this doesnt exist in requirements, what to do with it?
	- solution implemented: add extra section
	NOTE: it contains endpoints such as viable residues, non viable residues...

For micro
---------

- Further information required: this section has two main docs (summary and endpoint) without a specific section + viable and non-viable sections which can't be split and include several docs
	- solution implemented:
		- the two main endpoint + summary are in the higher-level sectionwhat about making an extra section
		- merge viable and non viable and output all docs together, for both summaries and endpoints
	- alternative: add section "other info" or similar to include the high level docs? (just for tidying up the document)


For MRL
-------
To clarify if to follow chemicals sections (as done for TOX) or do it different


Other issues
------------
- GAP links don't (cannot) work!!!
- link to methods section
