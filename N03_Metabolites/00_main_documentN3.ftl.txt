</#function>

To get inbound reference from a document, you can do the following:

<!—list through the inbound references of a document. Note the ‘document’ represents the user-defined variable name of the document.
<#list com.inboundReferences(document.documentKey) as inboundReferenceKey>

<!—check if an inbound ref. exists
<#if inboundReferenceKey?has_content>

<!—At this point you have the list of inbound references (UUIDs) with inboundReferenceKey, but this is perhaps not useful, now you need to get the doc. key like for cross-references in order to extract information from documents referencing the current document

<!—Assign a variable to get the document key (in this ncase for ‘inboundReferenceKey')
<#assign inboundReference = iuclid.getDocumentForKey(inboundReferenceKey) />
