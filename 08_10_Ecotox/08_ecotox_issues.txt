KCA
--------------------------------
8.1.1 - Effects on birds
	- created 2 new sections:
		- "other short-term" for endpoints: short-term toxicity to birds: avoidance (repellency) test, short-term toxicity to birds
		- "other"

8.2.2 - Long term toxicity fish
	- missing endpoints, maybe add to existing sections?
		- early life: add "fish short-term toxicity test on embryo and sac-fry stages", "fish, juvenile growth test" to existing "fish early-life stage toxicity"
		- full life: add "adult fish: sub(lethal) effects", "long-term toxicity to fish, other" to existing "fish life cycle toxicity"


8.2.5.4: if select long-term endpoint, where do the rest go? for the moment all endpoints will be potentially shown.

8.2.6: where to put endpoint "toxicity to aquatic algae and cyanobacteria". In cross walks this is in the main section, but probably doesn't make sense.

8.2.8: no specific doc exists, so this needs to necessarily point to section 8.7.

8.3.1.3: do all endpoints refer to actual development? + endpoints refer only to bees and not honeybees. We could correct this, but then another section should exist for the rest.

8.3.2.: section added for arthropods different than the two listed.

8.4: 	- eartworm: only sub-lethal? I include all of them for the moment.
	- unclear split (species level testing only for two species?), so far species level testing omitted. 
	Solution for the moment: just divided in earthworm/not earthworm based on species.

KMA
----------------------------------
Toxicity to earthworms: in reality all studies on macroorganisms will be here (regardless of being earthworm or not)

KCP
----------------------------------
10.1.1.1: in the crosswalks also other non-acute endpoints are included, but i don't consider them in order to be consistent with KCA
10.3.1.1: needs alignment with KCA in crosswalks, which looks better i.e. and i will based on that
	NOTE: also, no distinction of honeybee from other species
10.3.2.5: not possibile to distinguish at the moment - will be included in the sections above
10.4.1.1: sub-lethal includes everything on earthworms not being a field study.
10.6.1/2: merged together as remainder from studies (not field/semifield, extended) in 10.6.1 - to see if this makes sense
